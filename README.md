<h1>Embedded Input Reader</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, a Raspberry Pi Pico is used alongside multiplexers (MUXes) and basic logic gates to create a system that reads binary inputs represented by LEDs, translates them into their decimal equivalent, and toggles the corresponding output LED. By designing and wiring the circuit manually, I developed skills in digital logic design, binary-to-decimal conversion, hardware multiplexing, and embedded hardware control. The system processes inputs through combinational logic, minimizing software load and demonstrating efficient real-time signal decoding. This project strengthened my understanding of circuit prototyping, logic gate applications, microcontroller interfacing, and binary data handling at the hardware level.
